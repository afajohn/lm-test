Men marrying tradwives, therefore, is an example of antifeminism.</p><p>But it’s not always as simple as that.</p><p><strong>The Hive Mind Phenomenon</strong></p><p>Yes, there is danger in social media trends that spread hateful propaganda.</p><p>Measuring a woman’s worth only by how useful she is to the men in her life is a backward mindset. Plenty of discussions on the internet do, in fact, touch on this — and yes, even discussions involving the tradwife movement.</p><p>But sweeping statements rarely capture the whole picture, and since society does not operate on a hive mind, the issue is not nearly as black-and-white as it seems.</p><p>By popular definition, a tradwife is a homemaker. She cooks, cleans, and takes care of the children while her husband goes to work to provide for the family. Decades ago, this was often the only role available to women. Many people then believed it was the only role suited to them.</p><p>Now, many condemn the very notion of a tradwife. In this modern world, they would say, women should choose to be anything but one.</p><p>But does it really have to be one way or another?</p><figure><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/ester-sample/articleId-1-02.com/docsz/ad_4nxfdecqjroswukrymnvuzg7tsglcsdwd-ejo-vpjae-435rxlem4hnz1h51pwvovk2ir9mgfeanlirume0ysrlyblkbck9xk3otxnypsxtto1jrujr5_8o0xpk_g0rl2pv7eo3qhfw\" alt=\"A family having a meal at the table\" width=\"630\"><figcaption>The tradwife movement, when done right, can create beautiful and loving families with married couples who genuinely care for each other.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>It All Comes Down to Choices</strong></p><p>Doing one specific thing doesn’t automatically make you anti-feminist. Being against feminism is what makes you anti-feminist.</p><p>A lot of men are married to tradwives. Some of them are happy and successful partnerships, while others likely embody the very issues that many people are so concerned about when it comes to traditional gender roles.</p><p>The difference? Having a choice.</p><p>If you’re married to a woman who fits the bill when people describe tradwives, it doesn’t mean you’re a terrible husband. For all we know, you’re <strong>perfectly content and in love</strong>.</p><p>This is possible if you didn’t force your wife to limit herself to the role of a tradwife. If the choice was hers and you both acknowledge that being a stay-at-home mother and spouse doesn’t make her the lesser partner, then your marriage is not anti-feminist.</p><p>Because feminism promotes the freedom of women to have a choice, and this includes the decision to either reject or embrace traditional gender roles.</p><p>It’s true that there are aspects of the tradwife discourse that skirts the edges of antifeminism and misogyny. That is to be expected of any dialogue with countless people contributing.</p><p>But no one has the right to make generalizations and judge the way couples live their lives simply because they exhibit some of the characteristics of a controversial idea.</p><p>If people stop automatically assuming that men with tradwives hate women, perhaps we can better identify (and steer clear of) those who really do.</p>",

We can love the reality of the person we are dating or the ideal they represent. If the former is lacking and the latter takes precedence, then we may have just entered into the realm of <strong>fantasy bonding</strong>.</p><h2><strong>What Is Fantasy Bonding?</strong></h2><p>According to Psychologist Dr. Robert Firestone, \"Most people have fears of intimacy and are self-protective, while at the same time are terrified of being alone.\" To resolve this emotional dilemma, they form a fantasy bond, which replaces the substance of a loving relationship with the form of being a unit.</p><p>Going by the term itself, it refers to a situation where our bond with our partner is with a fantastical version of them instead of the real person. This means denying reality and holding on to an ideal; a mental doppelganger of our partner that does not really exist.</p><p>This does not imply, however, that it is wrong to hope for better things in the relationship. Yet, when that bond with the idealized version overtakes the bond with the real deal, then we deny ourselves a chance to have something genuine. Worse, we may even stay in relationships that no longer serve us when we choose to fantasy bond with our partner.</p><h2><strong>The Signs of a Fantasy Bond</strong></h2><p>Those who are curious to know whether they are in a fantasy bond or not can look out for a few common signs. The first thing to watch out for is a drop in genuine intimacy. This means a decreased display of actual affection and tenderness between partners.&nbsp;</p><p>In its place are routines meant to symbolize intimacy as opposed to living it. There will be far less spontaneity in the relationship, and the routines have a mechanical feel to them. There will also be a decrease in communication–in terms of any actual effort to communicate and the desire for it to begin with.</p><p>In spite of all that, those engaged in fantasy bonding also display far less individualism. It can be as though the partners have surrendered their independence to the relationship as a whole. Another sign related to this is in how the couple speak: more often than not, they talk as a unit, citing ‘we’ as opposed to ‘I’.</p><h2><strong>Why Do People Fantasy Bond?</strong></h2><p>At its core, fantasy bonding is rooted in fear. Many in relationships often struggle with intimacy. As the relationship deepens or progresses, those with intimacy issues turn to escapism to cope with the increased responsibilities. In creating an illusion of positive connection, these people can protect themselves from their unwanted feelings of vulnerability.</p><p>Fantasy bonding is also common among those in abusive relationships. To cope with their terrible reality, some abused individuals may cling to idealized versions of their abuser, in hopes that it will one day come true. Many who fantasy bond with their partners may have learned to do so in their childhood, due to <strong>rejection</strong> from emotionally distant parents.</p><p>While it is innately human to create and cling to ideals, <strong>fantasy bonding</strong> in adult relationships is far from a healthy habit. What’s worse is that many do not even realize that they are engaging in this detrimental behavior, which only makes things worse for them in the long run. As great as love can be, it is always better for it to be real and genuine as opposed to something fictional.</p>",

Well, remember that feeling because asking for such doesn’t stop even when you are an adult and dating a Filipina.</p><p>Even if you have earned her sweet yes and successfully asked for her hand in marriage, there’s still one more step you need to go through before considering the wedding preparations.</p><p>You need to ask her family’s consent to marry her.</p><h2><strong>But Why Should You Ask for Parental Consent?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>It is Filipino tradition for the prospective groom to formally ask for a blessing from the bride’s family. This is called <em>pamalayi </em>and has been practiced for centuries, continuing into modern times.</p><p>It isn’t a requirement, but getting the parent’s consent signifies the genuine intention of the couple to start a life together.&nbsp;</p><p>Family and respect are highly significant in Filipino culture; thus, <em>pamalayi</em> is a way to honor the parents before the couple enters married life.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Pamalayi</em> involves a well-brought-up and educated suitor and his family visiting the bride’s family home to formally declare his intentions to marry their daughter. The groom-to-be’s family can bring a gift for the hosts, usually in the form of Filipino dishes and delicacies.&nbsp;</p><p>This meeting can often be awkward, as it marks the first interaction between two families. Even the soon-to-be-weds will feel uneasy as they witness both sets of parents converse on wedding matters.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Do You Only Ask Her Father?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>In most cultures, the groom only asks permission from the bride’s father. However, in the Philippines, that is not the case.&nbsp;</p><p>To reiterate, Filipinos place great value on family. Therefore, in life-changing situations like marriage, they want the whole family to be involved in this joyous occasion. So, prepare to meet her extended family, such as her grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.&nbsp;</p><p>It might seem stressful to deal with the whole family. However, know that you’ve made it this far. You’re a step away from reaching the bliss of married life.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What If They Say No?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>If it were back then, you have to be prepared for rejection. But today, parents are more agreeable. You don’t need to fear anything, as the bride’s family rarely says no to the engagement. Thank God this kind of drama only happens in the movies.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, if you’ve been together for so long, her family will hardly contest your betrothal. <em>Pamalayi</em> in this day and age in the Philippines is only for formality's sake.&nbsp;</p><p>However, if her family DOES reject you, keep calm and express your good intentions for their daughter. There’s no denying that her parents only want the best for her.&nbsp;</p><p>So, try to question their concerns. Are they worried about your financial capacity to sustain the marriage? Or do they worry about your religious differences?&nbsp;</p><p>Hopefully, after some reassurance, they will change their minds and give you their blessing.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>When Should You Do It?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>When you should do it is entirely up to you. It can be several days, a week, or a month after your actual proposal. However, it’s wise to do it sooner rather than later. That way, you can focus on the wedding preparations and the like.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Prepare to Be In the Hot Seat</strong></h2><p>Marrying a Cebuana is not easy. Even if she agrees to your proposal, the path is still unclear. You’ll still have to jump through hoops in the form of her family before you can achieve your happily ever after.&nbsp;</p><p>Prepare to be in the hot seat once you’ve asked for parental consent.&nbsp;</p><p>Her family will throw difficult questions at you and maybe a few side eyes here and there. But understand that they only want to assess whether you’ll make their daughter happy and content. Just answer their queries from the heart, and you’ll also win them over.</p><p>And before I forget, when they offer you an alcoholic drink or two, never turn it down. It’s part of <em>pamalayi </em>and helps you loosen up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Good luck and best wishes on your upcoming marriage!</p>",

Who hasn’t felt hungover from a past love?&nbsp;</p><p>As we get through that stage, many might say that time will help heal the scars. However, the recovery period can be agonizing. Some days are easier than others, and the ugly moments feel magnified because of the pain you're trying to eliminate.&nbsp;</p><p>Why does the “I’m <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://odessawomen.com/dating/how-to-tell-if-women-are-not-interested.html\"><strong>getting over you</strong></a>” stage feel painful? How can one come out of it as a stronger person?&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The Sting of Getting Over Someone</strong></h2><p>Does the heartbreak still linger within you? If so, these reasons may provide some clarity behind your painful feelings.</p><p>One, it invites desperation. No one expects their relationships to end badly. With that, some of us look for ways to get the feeling of love back. But unfortunately, efforts aren’t always reciprocated, adding to the pain.</p><p>Two, heartbreak makes us lose control of our feelings. This is in line with the desperation in point #1. Since you’re lost in the hurt, all rational thoughts go out the door as you yearn for love and attention.</p><p>And three, you’re left feeling stuck in the past. You’re surrounded by memories of your ex, from photos down to specific locations. It’s as if everything around you is a reminder of what once was, and you can’t break through that loop.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Get a Clean Slate</strong></h2><p>We know getting over someone is easier said than done—especially if your breakup happened out of the blue. Letting go of feelings (especially unresolved ones) can feel like ripping off the bandage of a painful wound, but it’s necessary.</p><h3><strong>#1: Acknowledge and accept the circumstances</strong></h3><p>You can’t move on if you can’t make peace with reality. As said in a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://odessawomen.com/psychology/letting-go-toxic-relationships.html\"><strong>previous entry</strong></a>, don’t hold onto something that no longer exists. You can only move on when you finally accept reality, no matter how bad it hurts.</p><h3><strong>#2: Lean on reliable support</strong></h3><p>It can be tempting to shut everyone out while you're in pain. However, here’s a friendly reminder: you don’t have to bear the pain alone.</p><p>Surround yourself with people who truly care about your happiness because they have your back—no questions asked. Always remember that your family and friends are always there to comfort and support you.</p><h3><strong>#3: Step out of your bubble</strong></h3><p>Just because you’re nursing a broken heart doesn’t mean you should stop living your life. Make the most of your newfound freedom by trying new things! There’s no harm in going out of your comfort zone from time to time, so what better time than the present?&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>#4: Don’t make things harder for yourself</strong></h3><p>It’s easy to point the finger at yourself during times like this. But here’s something you should remember: none of your pain is your fault. Don’t fall into self-sabotaging behavior because you’ll only make moving on more difficult. Treat yourself with kindness because you deserve it—especially after heartbreak.</p><h3><strong>#5: Have faith and embrace optimism&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Reliving the past and hoping for a comeback will only hinder your progress. Channel your energy into a better future for yourself. You have so much more to live for, and that includes better relationships.</p><p>Whether someone’s getting over you or you’re the one in the moving-on process, we owe ourselves time to get through such a stage. There’s no rush, so go at your own pace. This isn’t a contest.</p>",

Your stomach may even churn just thinking about it.</p><p>As intimidating as the future is, you have no choice but to confront it. It’s inevitable if you want answers. Otherwise, you’ll constantly dwell on the what-ifs. Imagine them laughing at you as regret creeps in. Horrible, right?</p><p>You should broach the subject if you and the other person are in the same boat and want clarity.</p><p>So, how can you have this conversation?</p><p>You won’t have the easiest of experiences. Fortunately, here’s how you can navigate it with a clear head.</p><h2><strong>When’s The Right Time to Ask the Question?</strong></h2><p>Many believe that timing is everything. And there’s merit to that belief. You don’t want to catch your person off-guard.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no set time to ask this question. However, you should broach the subject if you and the other person are in the same boat and want some clarity.&nbsp;</p><p>It would help if you have a complete understanding of what your relationship is before steering things into this discussion.</p><h2><strong>How Should You Handle That Conversation?</strong></h2><p>It’s normal to hesitate. After all, it’s a huge question. But how will you get your answers if you don't rip that band-aid off? Don’t wait until you reach the point of no return.</p><p>Here are some tips to handle this necessary conversation:</p><h3><strong>#1: Make your desires clear.</strong></h3><p>You’re allowed to want what you want. It’s 2024, and shame is a wasted feeling. You’ve been hesitant for long enough.&nbsp;</p><p>Acknowledge and express your desires. Clarity shouldn’t be a tall order. Knowing and vocalizing what you want helps drive your relationship toward your intended course.</p><h3><strong>#2: Admit your nervousness.&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>If you’re nervous, good news: it’s normal. Your person is likely feeling the same as you. The nerves aren’t just from fear of confrontation. Sometimes, they come from a fear of committing to the wrong match.</p><p>You’re allowed to admit your nervousness. It’ll likely help diffuse the tension.</p><h3><strong>#3: Don’t put too much pressure.</strong></h3><p>Since we’re on the subject of tension, don’t make things feel heavier by adding extra pressure to the conversation. The “what are we” talk is serious, but that doesn’t mean you can’t make it light and optimistic.</p><p>For instance, instead of putting on a serious tone and asking the question, perhaps you can mention how you stopped seeing other potential partners or have uninstalled the dating apps on your phone.</p><h3><strong>#4: Do it in person.</strong></h3><p>As convenient as calling and instant messaging are, conversations like this should happen <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://odessawomen.com/psychology/getting-ukrainian-women-to-approach-you-first.html\"><strong>in person</strong></a>. The internet is ambiguous, and you don’t want to start things off in an avoidant fashion.</p><h3><strong>#5: Don’t demand instant answers.</strong></h3><p>Your person may not have an immediate answer, and that’s okay. The conversation just planted the seeds, so wait for them to grow. Like you, they need time to think things over.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The Ball Is in Your Court</strong></h3><p>The decision lies in your hands. Will you end your story here? Or will you pick things up and continue where you left off?</p><p>The answers you gain after the “what are we” conversation should help you make a wise choice. Make sure it’s something you won’t regret in the long run.</p>",

Meanwhile, they’re just there, taking everything without giving back.</p><p>It’s 2024, and I’m sure we’ve all heard this phrase: <em>if he wanted to, he would</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s how it works: if somebody’s interested in or wants to be with you, they’ll let you know or work to make it happen. If they don’t, you’re better off moving on. The meaning is simple enough to understand.</p><p>Don’t get it twisted—there’s truth to that mantra. Why settle for somebody who won’t match your energy?&nbsp;</p><p>Many of us have been (and still are) in setups similar to the intro above. Some gaslight themselves into thinking their partners express their feelings differently compared to them. I don’t fault people for believing that. If a man wanted to, he would, and vice versa.</p><p>But if the walls surrounding you could talk, they’d tell you to give up because they’ve seen enough. Sometimes, we need a sobering reality check to set ourselves on the right path. Think of it as divine intervention. Don’t waste time waiting for someone who won’t change.</p><p>However, sometimes, it’s more complicated.</p><p>Humans have so much nuance that it’s impossible to simplify things into one statement. Moreover, circumstances vary from person to person. That said, there <em><strong>are</strong></em><strong> </strong>valid reasons people don’t make moves, even if they want to.</p><p>First, they may still have unresolved feelings left on the back burner. Sometimes, it’s trauma. In other cases, they’re still reeling from their most recent breakups. Whatever it is, they’re still preoccupied with the ghosts of their past. Life happens, and sometimes it gets in the way of people.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, the “if he wanted to, he would” philosophy implies we’re mind readers, which we aren’t. While we can get hints from our partners, that doesn’t mean we always get it right.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of us can grasp things with little to no instruction. However, others need their partners to give them a direct order to make things happen. I can’t overstate the need for communication enough. If you’ve got something to say, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://odessawomen.com/dating/how-to-communicate.html\"><strong>say it</strong></a>!</p><p>Lastly, the reason can be dismissive and generalizing. It gives the impression that no statement is a statement in itself and doesn’t tell the whole story. While the statement can be true sometimes, we can’t tag other situations under the “he would if he wanted to” category.&nbsp;</p><p>Some people don’t want to do the work of getting together with someone. However, that doesn’t change the fact that they have feelings for and care about you. So no, it’s not a “you” problem. They just aren’t ready for a relationship, and that’s on them. And it’s not an indictment on them; it’s just a fact.</p><p>The “if he wanted to, he would” argument isn’t a one-size-fits-all mantra. Not every situation is black-and-white.

Scientifically, that's one full year before a person has a fully developed<strong> pre-frontal cortex</strong> — the part of the brain responsible for reasoning, planning, judgment, impulse control, and… ta-da! Emotions!&nbsp;</p><p>This means once you grow further into adulthood, your brain becomes more rational. However, in the case of love, logic is often thrown out the window. As neuroscience puts it — love can be illogical.</p><h2><strong>Should I Be Single Until 25?</strong></h2><p>No! At least, not exactly. As Ed Sheeran sang in <em>Thinking Out Loud</em>, “People fall in love in mysterious ways.” Love doesn’t have a time frame or a due date, and definitely, no jail time solely because you aren’t swept off your feet. Your desire for balance, love, and purpose is normal.</p><h2><strong>Focus On Yourself</strong></h2><p>Look both on the inside and outside. Physical attractiveness is hitting two birds with one stone — a grabber for your potential love interest and a self-confidence boost. Hitting your fitness goal, treating yourself with skincare or annual facials, or being productive with your passions may be costly, but its wonders to your mental health will surely make you a charmer as stated in a study by McCroskey and McCain.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>&lt;H2&gt; Regulate Yourself&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>You may want to sit and write down your short-term goals. Stay present, be mindful of your capabilities, honor your pace, and surround yourself with great friends. These could ease down your narrowness in targeting a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://mydreamasian.com/realities/dating-age-gap-asian-women-prefer.html\"><strong>specific age in finding love</strong></a> as you focus on socializing, relieving stress, and feeling a sense of belonging even without the romantic aspect yet.</p><h2><strong>Explore Endless Possibilities</strong></h2><p>In having the courage to explore uncertainties, you get to unlock self-discovery beyond what you deem common. You get to create a life full of richness and resilience and instill these in others. Why not start a new hobby? Start up a business? Write a book? Save to travel overseas? Do volunteer work? Explore online dating?&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Be True to Yourself</strong></h2><p>People don’t fully remember if you have the best outfits or the latest iPhone model. Appreciation deepens when you know your character. With that, who you truly are overshadows your appearance. As stated by LH Recovery, don’t be afraid to be assertive and show up as you are.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Going into your mid-twenties might have certain advantages such as kickstarting your maturity. Whether you have a fully developed <strong>pre-frontal cortex</strong> or not, you are just as worthy of love and affection. Embrace your side of weirdness, give yourself grace in growth, and don’t waste the lessons in between.&nbsp;</p><p>So, does love come only after a fully developed pre-frontal cortex? We don’t think so.&nbsp;</p><p>Love exists because you are living right now in the first place anyway.</p>",

For many, this means Halloween costumes and spooky stories. Meanwhile, for others, the 11th month of the year is the start of engagement season. Yes—it’s a thing! It’s not an official holiday, but it exists.</p><p>This season can be a lot to take in, regardless of your relationship status. Here’s how to wade through its waters in one piece.</p><h2><strong>When Is Engagement Season?</strong></h2><p>What’s in the November air, you ask? Per The Knot’s Engagement &amp; Jewelry Study, around 20% of couples get engaged between November and February. And this makes sense!</p><p>These months are peppered with holidays, which means people gather with their families. These reunions are great opportunities for celebrating such a huge life chapter.</p><p>If you’re planning to put a ring on your partner, I suggest following this popular timetable. Make your holidays even merrier with their sweet “yes.”</p><h2><strong>The Pressure Hits</strong></h2><p>As the season begins, you’ll see an engagement reveal or two on social media. Whether you’re single or partnered up, you may feel pressure creeping in.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re in the latter group, you might not help but make comparisons when you see people take that leap. While you’re happy in your relationship, you may feel lumps forming in your throat as you scan through proposal posts. Your mental clock starts ticking, wondering whether it’s time for you and your partner to also get engaged.</p><p>On the other hand, if you’re the former, the engagement season may trigger you. Watching couples bask in their love and move forward to a new relationship milestone can make you doubt your potential as a partner. You may feel left behind as the world seemingly moves on without you.</p><h2><strong>Get a Hold of the Pressure</strong></h2><p>The anxiety around this season is a complex feeling. That said, though, it isn’t an impossible hill to climb. Take these tips to heart as you manage your stress:</p><p><strong>#1: Your feelings are valid.</strong></p><p>There’s no right or wrong way to feel about this season. You’re entitled to your feelings; no one can take that away.</p><p>If you’re over the moon for your engaged friends and family, that’s great! Who wouldn’t want to see their loved ones get their happily ever afters? Be supportive and show up for your people.&nbsp;</p><p>But if pressure and anxiety are bubbling at the pit of your stomach, don’t deny yourself that. Feel what you feel—even if it seems ugly.</p><p><strong>#2: Don’t compare yourself to others.</strong></p><p>Theodore Roosevelt was right: comparison is the thief of joy. Engagements are happy news, so don’t let comparisons taint that. It’s normal to ask yourself when your turn is, but don’t let that thought linger longer than necessary.</p><p>Your time will come. It may not be as soon as you wish, but <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://odessawomen.com/dating/staying-positive-while-pursuing-ukrainian-women.html\"><strong>it will happen</strong></a>. Don’t let comparisons shake your faith.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>#3: Talk to your partner or yourself, whichever applies.</strong></p><p>Even if a proposal isn’t on your wishlist now, take this season to check in with your partner. Talk about your priorities, wants, and goals. Who knows—that conversation may give you the clarity you need.</p><p>If you’re single, take this moment to have some deep-seated reflections. How do you genuinely feel about the season? What do you want for yourself in terms of relationships down the line? While they aren’t burning questions, their answers are still helpful.</p><p><strong>#4: Establish and maintain boundaries.</strong></p><p>Since this season has many family gatherings coinciding with it, your vulnerability may be higher because of their questions, especially regarding your love life. While (mostly) well-intentioned, it <em>can </em>get annoying and invasive.&nbsp;</p><p>With that, affirm your boundaries by stating your discomfort around their questions politely and firmly. That should be enough for them to pivot the conversation.</p><p>Don’t let the pressures of the engagement season sour your joy. Whether you’re getting hitched or not, you should enjoy this happy period without dark clouds hovering over you.</p>",

You disappoint each other, make mistakes, and argue now and then. In a healthy relationship, you’ll discuss it, then kiss and make up.</p><p></p><p>But if constant suspicions and recurring bouts of jealousy fill your day, perhaps there lies a deeper problem.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>One common yet unsuspecting cause is your insecurities in a relationship.</p><p></p><p>Often, when problems arise, couples reflect on their partner's behavior and the relationship. But have you ever stopped to think that perhaps the deeper problem lies in you?</p><p></p><h2><strong>1. Afraid to Lose Your Partner</strong></h2><p></p><p><em>Do you often doubt if you’re enough and have what it takes to make your partner happy?</em></p><p></p><p>If you have insecurities in a relationship, the most dominant fear is losing your partner.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>It's usual to want to stay with them, but it becomes the opposite if you're constantly overthinking their actions and looking for signs they’re losing interest in you.</p><p></p><p>If you take their reactions and even random remarks as evidence that they’re unsatisfied with you and the relationship, you become defensive and constantly alert for the worst.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>In other words, you fail to see the good in your relationship.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>2. No Boundaries</strong></h2><p></p><p>Because you fear losing them, you want to keep your partner within sight. So, you resort to stalking them on social media when you are apart. Or, if they have plans with friends, you always want to tag along to keep watch.</p><p></p><p>If they ask for some alone time, you assume they’re tired of your company.</p><p></p><p>Understandably, you’re feeling insecure in a relationship. But such behavior <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://ukrainesingles.com/dating/what-turns-off-ukrainian-women.html\"><strong>disrespects your partner’s boundaries</strong></a> and will eventually suffocate them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>3. Jealousy</strong></h2><p></p><p>Almost every person who approaches your partner becomes a subject of jealousy. You’re anxious they might meet someone better or prefer their friends over you.</p><p></p><p>People in their life become your competition, so you keep them fenced to make yourself feel secure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>4. Demands Constant Reassurance</strong></h2><p></p><p>When you suffer from insecurities in a relationship, compulsive questions such as,<em> “Do you love me?”</em> or <em>“Are you angry?\"</em> are a staple in your conversations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You constantly ask for reassurance and compliments because you feel like their love and support are never enough. While these may benefit you, being the target of these inquiries can be exhausting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>5. Controlling</strong></h2><p></p><p><em>You want this, you want that, and you want everything to go your way.</em></p><p></p><p>Because of your intense need for security in the relationship, you try to take the reins, whether that’s where you go out to date, what they wear, or who they can meet. You want to know every detail about them and try to manipulate their thoughts to gain your desired outcome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>6. Overly Submissive</strong></h2><p></p><p>While most insecure partners try to take control, some can do the opposite.</p><p></p><p>Since you fear losing your partner, you’ll tend to submit to them. You let them decide and even ask for their opinions first to avoid offending them. You prefer what they want over yours, but you neglect your needs in the process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Better Yourself and Your Relationship</strong></h2><p></p><p>Reflect and see if you possess the signs mentioned. Because if you do and they lead to more trouble than peace in your relationship, it might be time to learn how to deal with insecurities in a relationship.</p><p></p><p>Insecurities often stem from deep-seated wounds from childhood experiences or past relationships. That being said, seek inner healing through the guidance of a professional. If not, reach out to your family or friends who can offer support.</p><p></p><p>Once you take steps to change and attain self-security, this will also reflect in your relationship.</p>",
